# In this project I have built a console traffic simulator using C++
The purpose of this was to expand my object oriented programming abilities and also expand my comfortability in C++. Here I have created many classes within 6 files all being pulled together in a main program to simulate traffic intersections.

## To implement please clone this repository

## Navigate into the directory on the command line

## Build and link all files using your systems c++ compiler (clang, g++, etc)

## Run the executable output file

#### **NOTE** you can adjust parameters in main to determine how many roads and traffic lights will be simulated
